            Beyond architecture, I specialize in web development and eCommerce, building sleek, fully functional websites using Nuxt and Vue.js. My experience also extends to branding and business, having previously run a fashion brand and now working on rebranding it for a stronger comeback.
            In addition, I’m venturing into YouTube automation, aiming to build and monetize multiple channels. My goal is to streamline content creation, automate processes, and eventually scale with a dedicated team.
            I believe in diligence, self-improvement, and strategic growth, balancing my time between academics and entrepreneurial pursuits. Every project I take on is driven by my commitment to excellence, innovation, and impact.</h1>
